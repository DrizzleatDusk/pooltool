# Resources

This is the landing page for all the exposition-style documentation available for pooltool.

:::{note}
All current development bandwidth is being spent on documenting the API. Once that is complete, resource documents will start to take shape (and priority). Until then, this page will remain somewhat bare. If what you're looking for isn't here, hopefully you can find it in the [API Reference](#pooltool) or the [blog](https://ekiefl.github.io/projects/pooltool/).
