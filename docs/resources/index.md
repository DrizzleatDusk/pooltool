This is the landing page for all the exposition-style documentation available for pooltool.

:::{note}
All current development bandwidth is being spent on documenting the API. Once that is complete, these documents will start to take shape. Until then, hopefully you can find what you're looking for either in the [API Reference](#pooltool) or the [blog](https://ekiefl.github.io/projects/pooltool/).
