def roots_numerical(p):
    """Solve multiple polynomial equations

    This is a vectorized implementation of numpy.roots that can solve multiple
    polynomials in a vectorized fashion. The solution is taken from this wonderful
    stackoverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35853977

    Parameters
    ==========
    p : array
        A mxn array of polynomial coefficients, where m is the number of equations and
        n-1 is the order of the polynomial. If n is 5 (4th order polynomial), the
        columns are in the order a, b, c, d, e, where these coefficients make up the
        polynomial equation at^4 + bt^3 + ct^2 + dt + e = 0

    Notes
    =====
    - This function is not amenable to numbaization (0.54.1). There are a couple of
      hurdles to address. p[...,None,0] needs to be refactored since None/np.newaxis
      cause compile error. But even bigger an issue is that np.linalg.eigvals is only
      supported for 2D arrays, but the strategy here is to pass np.lingalg.eigvals a
      vectorized 3D array.

    ==========

    solver:
        How should the roots be calculated? Choose one of {"numeric",
        "quartic_analytic"}. "numeric" works for n-degree polynomials,
        "quartic_analytic" works for quartics and is fast.
    tol:
        Roots are real if their imaginary components are less than than tol.

    Returns
    =======
    output : (time, index)
        `time` is the minimum real root from the set of polynomials, and `index`
        specifies the index of the responsible polynomial. i.e. the polynomial with the
        root `time` is p[index]
