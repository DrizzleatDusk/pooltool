  abstract = "In this paper, some key technologies based on colour image
              processing for 8-ball billiards robot vision system are discussed
              and an efficient approach for multi-objective recognition is
              proposed. This approach is divided into two parts, i.e.
              multi-objective detection and ball pattern recognition. In image
              pre-processing, the normalized RGB colour space and histogram
              statistics are adopted for segmentation of background (table
              cover) and foregrounds. In order to accurately locate and isolate
              the single ball in a local region, the improved Hough Transform
              (HT) algorithm and the Least Squares (LS) method are adopted in
              combination. The improved HT algorithm is used for the purpose of
              eliminating the noise concentrated at edge points, and the LS
              method is used for fitting the circle center accurately with the
              least mean square error. Based on single ball detection in a
              local region, the multi-ball detection approach has been worked
              out to locate the position of each ball on the table. In the
              experiment, the proposed approach has been proved to complete the
              detection with an accuracy of 99.4\% in 0.65s in average, and the
              performance is betterthan the traditional Circular Hough
              Transform (CHT) algorithm and the K-means cluster method. In
              addition, the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) method is adopted
              for pattern recognition of each target ball being segmented, i.e.
              identification of a solid ball or a striped ball. In order to
              improve the quality of CNN training: the colour segmentation and
              morphologic operation are applied for the segmented ball image
              pre-processing; the training set images are rotated for
              augmentation; pre-training stage is introduced in for optimizing
              the initial weight matrices. The calibrated image blocks are
              imported to the network for training. In the verification test,
              the trained CNN model shows a recognition rate of over 98.5\%,
              and outperforms the other three classic methods. The introduction
              of CNN method has been proved to be correct and effective, and is
              an innovative and significant stepfor the design process of the
              8-ball billiards robot vision system.",

  abstract  = "The last two decades have seen a number of developments in
               creating robots to play billiards. The designed robotic systems
               have successfully incorporated the kinematics required and have
               had appropriate machine vision elements for a decent gameplay.
               Independently, computer scientists have also developed the
               artificial intelligence programs needed for the strategy to play
               billiards. Despite these developments, the accurate ball
               manipulation aspect of the game, needed for good performance,
               has not been addressed enough; two important parameters are the
               potting accuracy and advantageous cue ball positioning for next
               shot. In this regard, robotic ball manipulation by predicting
               the ball trajectories under the action of various dynamic
               phenomena, such as ball spin, impacts and friction, is the key
               consideration of this research. By establishing a connection to
               the methods used in nonprehensile robotic manipulation, a
               forward model is developed for the rolling, sliding, and two
               distinct types of frictional impacts of billiards balls are
               developed. High-speed camera-based tracking is performed to
               determine the physical parameters required for the developed
               dynamic models. To solve the inverse manipulation problem, i.e.,
               the decision on shot parameters, for accurate ball positioning,
               an optimization based solution is proposed. A simplistic ball
               manipulator is designed and used to test the theoretical
               developments. Experimental results show that a 90\% potting
               accuracy and a 100-200 mm post-shot cue ball positioning
               accuracy has been achieved by the autonomous system within a

               displays them in a guidance monitor. For rapid and
               systematically calculating the solution paths, the five and half
               system that is the most representative method in the field of
               billiard is implemented. In addition, the paths of the cue ball
               changed by the direction of the cue stick are predicted in real
               time and projected onto the pool table bed. By comparing the
               solution paths of the cue ball with the projected paths, a
               player can hit the cue ball easily and successfully. For
               automatically providing the solution paths and the predicted
               paths during billiard game, the ball movement is detected by the
               principal component analysis under linear motion constraints
               robustly against image noise, occlusion, and so on. Whenever all
               of the balls stop, both paths are newly calculated and provided
               for a player. For verifying the feasibility of the proposed
               Intelligent Carom Billiards Assistive System, the experiments

              billiards sports are useful tools for pure entertainment or
              improving the player's skills. Depending on the purpose of these
              systems, tracking algorithms based on computer vision must be
              used. These algorithms are especially useful in systems aiming to
              reconstruct the trajectories followed by the balls after a
              strike. However, depending on the billiard modality, the problem
              of tracking multiple small identical objects, such as balls, is a
              complex task. In addition, when an amateur or nontop professional
              player uses low-frame-rate and low-resolution devices, problems
              such as blurred balls, blurred contours, or fuzzy edges, among
              others, arise. These effects have a negative impact on
              ball-tracking accuracy and reconstruction quality. Thus, this
              work proposes two contributions. The first contribution is a new
              tracking algorithm called ``multiobject local tracking (MOLT)''.
              This algorithm can track balls with high precision and accuracy
              even with motion blur caused by low-resolution and low-frame-rate
              devices. Moreover, the proposed MOLT algorithm is compared with
              nine tracking methods and four different metrics, outperforming
              the rest of the methods in the majority of the cases and
              providing a robust solution. The second contribution is a whole
              system to track (using the MOLT algorithm) and reconstruct the
              movements of the balls on a billiard table in a 3D virtual world
              using computer vision. The proposed system covers all steps from
              image capture to 3D reconstruction. The 3D reconstruction results
              have been qualitatively evaluated by different users through a
              series of questionnaires, obtaining an overall score of 7.6 (out
              of 10), which indicates that the system is a promising and useful
              tool for training. Finally, both the MOLT algorithm and the
              reconstruction system are tested in three billiard modalities:
              blackball, carom billiards, and snooker.",

              9-ball tournaments. The break shots of 275 frames (241 men's, 34
              women's) of professional tournaments were analyzed from two
              aspects: (1) cue ball position, represented by the distance
              between the cue ball and the table center, and (2) ball
              distribution, indicated by the standard deviation of Voronoi cell
              areas determined from all remaining balls on the table. Spearman
              correlation and binary logistic regression were utilized to
              identify associations and to predict the frame outcomes,
              respectively. Results showed that the more balls falling into the
              pockets during the break, the more clustered the remaining balls
              (r s = 0.232, p < 0.001). The closer the cue ball ending toward
              the table center, the more balls potted in the visit immediately
              after the break (r s = -0.144, p = 0.027). Neither cue ball
              position nor ball distribution could predict table clearance or

              Specifically, we have decided to focus on a pool/billiard game
              due to its geometry simplicity. The model involves several balls
              moving freely and rolling, suffering different kinds of
              contacts/impacts among them and against the cushions and the
              cloth. In this system, the proper modelling of both contact and
              friction forces in the multiple, simultaneous contacts and
              impacts events is critical to obtain consistent results. In
              addition, these forces are complicated to model because of its
              nonlinear behaviour. The different existing approaches when
              dealing with multiple-contact events are briefly described, along
              with their most distinctive features. Then, the interactions
              identified on the model are implemented using several nonlinear
              contact-force models, following a smooth-based approach and
              considering friction phenomena, aiming at determining the most
              suitable set of both contact and friction force models for each
              of these implemented interactions, which take place
              simultaneously, thus resulting in a complex system with multiple
              impacts. Subsequently, the solving method that provides the most
              accurate results at the minimum computational cost is determined
              by testing a simple shot. Finally, the different interactions on
              the model are verified using experimental results and previous
              works. One of the main goals of this work is to show the some of
              the issues that arise when dealing with multiple-simultaneous
              impact multibody systems from a smooth-contact approach, and how
              researchers can deal with them.",

              billiard assistant (VBA), that should ultimately be able to
              replace a qualified human trainer. The scope of the project is
              the tactical part of three cushion billiards, where players have
              to solve a ball configuration, and play it accordingly, in order
              to score a point. The VBA proposed in this thesis has two main
              tasks: 1. Find a best solution for any possible ball
              configuration 2. Present this solution to the user A solution is
              considered best when a human trainer would recommend the same
              solution in the same situation. When a user is exercising, it can
              ask the VBA to solve a ball configuration whenever he desires.
              The ball configuration is retrieved using a webcam and image
              processing techniques, and presented to the VBA. The VBA then
              systematically tries out a vast amount of shot parameter
              combinations, and detects which are successful. To achieve this
              it makes use of a physical model, which is implemented in such a
              way that it can accurately simulate a great amount of shots in
              limited time. This will typically result in a set of solutions,
              which are first clustered and then sorted. The top solution of
              this sorted set should be the same solution as a human expert
              trainer would recommend. The resulting solutions are presented to
              the user via a computer screen, using a 3d model of a billiards
              table, with a white line indicating the path along which the cue
              ball should travel. It is shown that the system is accurate, and
              reasonably fast. Feasible solutions are found for almost all
              possible ball configurations. The method of interaction enables
              the user to move freely, and use the system as he or she desires.

  abstract  = "AbstractThe last two decades have seen a growing interest in
               research related to billiards. There have been a number of
               projects aimed at developing training systems, robots, and
               computer simulations for billiards. Determination of billiard
               ball trajectories is important for all of these systems. The
               ball's collision with a cushion is often encountered in
               billiards and it drastically changes the ball trajectory,
               especially when the ball has spin. This work predicts ball
               bounce angles and bounce speeds for the ball's collision with a
               cushion, under the assumption of insignifi-cant cushion
               deformation. Differential equations are derived for the ball
               dynamics during the impact and these equations are solved
               numerically. The numerical solutions together with previous
               experimental work by the authors predict that for the
               ball?cushion collision, the values of the coefficient of
               restitution and the sliding coefficient of friction are 0.98 and
               0.14, respectively. A comparison of the numerical and
               experimental results indicates that the limiting normal
               velo-city under which the rigid cushion assumption is valid is
               2.5 m/s. A number of plots that show the rebound characteristics
               for given ball velocity?spin conditions are also provided. The
               plots quantify various phenomena that have hitherto only been
               described in the billiards literature.",

              numerical simulation program. The friction exists between the
              ball and the table bed as well as between the ball and the rail.
              There are three parts in the dynamic behavior of the ball on the
              table bed; motion of the ball on the table bed, collision between
              balls, and collision between the ball and the cushion. During the
              development of the simulation program, the dynamics problems such
              as rolling motion and three-dimensional frictional impact motion
              have been analyzed in detail. The theoretical issues are
              implemented into a viable graphic simulation program and its
              efficacy is demonstrated through the experimental validation of
              the billiards game. The resulting analysis results are verified
              quantitatively and qualitatively using high-speed video camera.
              Through the experimental tests, it was found that the physical
              parameters such as coefficients of restitution and friction vary
              according to the motion variables and corresponding empirical
              formulations were developed. The simulation and experimental

               analytically. It is shown that the occurrences of all possible
